=========
One of the assignments in the class will be to answer, 'how can minecraft be used to express good history?'

Here, I'm generating DEMs and loading them into Worldpainter for translation into Minecraft worlds.

The next step would be to load a historical map into the world, overlaying it, and using it to guide the generation of more materials. The students will of course do all this from first principles. 

Workflow
========
For the DEMs, I'm grabbing data from http://dwtkns.com/srtm/
I then load it into Microdem for clipping and converting to grayscale http://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/microdem/win32/microdem_setup.exe

This DEM is loaded into World painter http://www.worldpainter.net/ .

Worldpainter can also load the historical map image overlays.

*more to come*
