Found these files on my machine from a few years ago. I believe the data came from the [Digital Atlas of Augustan Rome](http://digitalaugustanrome.org/)

The heights are a bit messed up, but you can make your own version using WorldPainter, and scaling appropriate. Import the greyscale jpg as your height map.
